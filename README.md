#Matrix calculator

This project is intended to be a matrix calculator, which will perform
matrix addition, subtraction, and multiplication and more basic operations.
To follow afterwards will be a nullspace and column space calculator.

The project is intended to summarize my C++ skills and implement a program that can utilize
most of them. This program will also develop along the lines of my linear algebra class and 
create functionalities based on the topics learned
