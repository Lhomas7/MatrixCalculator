# PersonalProjects

/*This project is intended to be a matrix calculator, which will perform
matrix addition, subtraction, and multiplication as basic operations.
To follow afterwards will be a nullspace and column space calculator.

Eventually, the project will hopefully expand to include a determinant
calculator as well as an eigenvalue calculator, and perhaps even include
matrix decomposition forms.*/
